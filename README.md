# Quartus-Timer-Stopper
A timer/stopper using quartus envoirment 
<br/>This is my final project in digital systems lab.<br/>
The task was to build a simple stopper in quartus, upgrade it as I will and then burn it to FPGA (I used DE-0 lite).<br/>
I started by building the simple stopper that shows seconds on the seven segement display, and then upgrading it by adding minutes to the seven segement display,
adding a reverse function and lastly adding a function for the user to add the start time as input.<br/>
To open  the project open the qar file with quartus.
